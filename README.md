# Sanders Lab @ UCSF https://sanderslab.github.io/
This repositiory includes scripts that were created during my rotation in the Sander's lab during the fall of 2018. 

The firts script () is to make a candlestick plot of mutations in cases versus controls over a moving window. While the script is currently hard coded to look at upstream and downstream variants, it can easily be changed to subset down to other variables within the VEP annotation file and create the plot.
